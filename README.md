# README: matrixAddition.c

This repository contains a C program called `matrixAddition.c` which takes two user input matrices, adds them and prints the result.

## Installation

To use this program, you must have a C compiler installed on your system such as [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/). Clone this repository to your local machine and compile the `matrixAddition.c` file using your preferred compiler.

```bash
gcc -o matrixAddition matrixAddition.c
```

This will create an executable file called `matrixAddition`.

## Usage

After compiling the program, you can run the `matrixAddition` executable from the command line.

```bash
./matrixAddition
```

The program will then display the sum of the two hardcoded matrices.

## Future Improvements

- Implement error handling for invalid matrix input
- Add support for other matrix operations (e.g., subtraction, multiplication)
